## Introduction  
This gitHub page is created to submit and share the final project have been done by Barış Terzi & Ozan Balcı in Machine Learning Course which is instructed by Özgün Balaban.

Purpose is to generate game maps alike map of the game 'Assassins Creed: Origin'. <br/>
Two main steps occur in the flowchart: <br/>
- Picking aerial or satellite images of the desirable location;
- Converting it into the game map.

CycleGan method is used to achieve the objective. For this purpose, open source model of Jun-Yan Zhu is used. <br/>

## cycleGan_mix  
'Rank, Name, Year, Duration' information of the Top 50 Movies of IMDB has been scrapped from the IMDB website and written in a .csv file.

Unsolved Problems are:
- Since ',' is a seperator in .csv, movie names which include ',' are seperated to different shells involuntarily.
- 'Year' information comes within paranthesis and it can not be removed.
- Some information such as 'Director, Gross, IMDB Rating' can not be pulled from the website.
